<h2>jQuery Share Plugin</h2>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> This plugin no longer has complete functionality. In November 2015, Twitter disabled their public API for examining the number of tweets associated with a given link.</p>
<p>This is a simple jQuery plugin designed to allow tabulate and display the number of Facebook likes and tweets for a given URL, as well as tabulate the combined shares from Facebook and Twitter. Additionally, it allows users to tweet or share a given link. It's designed to be accessible for a wide range of users and work across both mobile and desktop.</p>
